        <h2>Introduce data</h2>
        <p> Shows a dialog in which the size of the vector to order
            is requested, later a new dialogue asks to introduce
            the elements of the vector.
            It is equivalent to selecting the computer icon from the

            the type of random generation and, optionally, the lower and higher
            limits than the elements of the random vector to be generated.
            It is equivalent to selecting the dice icon from the
