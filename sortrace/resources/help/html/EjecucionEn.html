        <h1>Execution</h1>

        <h2>Pause</h2>
        <p> Stops continuous execution of the algorithm. It is equivalent to selecting
            the pause icon from the <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>

        <h2>Go back to the beginning</h2>
        <p> Go back to the beginning of the algorithm's execution. It is equivalent to
            select the triple arrow icon to the left from the
            <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>

        <h2>Go back to the beginning of the iteration</h2>
        <p> Go back to the beginning of the last executed iteration of the algorithm.
            It is equivalent to selecting the double arrow icon towards the
            left from the<a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>

        <h2>Go back one step</h2>
        <p> Go back one step in the execution of the algorithm. It is equivalent to selecting
            the left arrow icon (ending in a vertical bar)
            from the <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>

        <h2>Backward continuous</h2>
        <p> Go back the execution of the algorithm continuously step by step.
            It is equivalent to selecting the arrow icon to the left from the
            <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>

        <h2>Advance continuous</h2>
        <p> It advances the execution of the algorithm continuously step by step.
            It is equivalent to selecting the arrow icon to the right of the
            <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>

        <h2>Take one step forward</h2>
        <p> Go one step further in the execution of the algorithm. It is equivalent to selecting the
            icon of the right arrow (ending in a vertical bar) from the
            <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>

        <h2>Advance to the end of the iteration</h2>
        <p> Advances to the end of the current iteration of the algorithm. Is equivalent
            to select the double arrow icon to the right from the
            <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>

        <h2>Advance to the end</h2>
        <p> Advances to the end of the algorithm execution. It is equivalent to
            select the triple arrow icon to the right from the
            <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Exit execution</h2>
        <p> It exit the execution of the algorithm, returning to its initial state.
            It is equivalent to selecting the cross icon on the
            <a href="BarraIconosEn.html">icon bar</a>.</p>
